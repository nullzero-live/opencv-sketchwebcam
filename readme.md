OpenCV WebCam Sketch

Based on the tutorial by:
https://iq.opengenus.org/developing-a-live-sketching-app-using-opencv-and-python/

- Configured to work with webcam and not external camera as yet. Curious to dive into that a bit more.
- The extra detail about image processing is helpful in understanding what is happening.

Looking forward to experimenting more with OpenCV
